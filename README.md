# What is this?
 
 Back in around 2010, there was a popular gamemode on classic Minecraft called Lava Survival.
 We're bring it back to modern Minecraft.
 The point of the game was to escape the lava flood. You would have around 5 minutes to build.
 Back then, lava could engulf an entire map due to a quirk with the liquid physics.
 This skript not only brings back the old physics, but also adds in the whole gamemode.
